# EnergyMonitor in Nuxt

EnergyMonitor was originally an Express-based web app built
by a team of Students at the University of East Anglia:
- Ollie Bull
- Scott Gurney
- Charlie Eldridge
- Ellie Hannigan

#### The Original EnergyMonitor
EnergyMonitor was originally built to assist remote communities in Cape York with the adoption of renewable energy. Providing users with a reasonably accurate prediction of their energy input (solar), expenditure and storage (batteries).

#### Why Rewrite it?
I am using EnergyMonitor as a relevant case study to work on whilst I learn about how to develop web applications with Nuxt3
